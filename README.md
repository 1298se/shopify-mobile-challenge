# Description

A memory matching game using data from a provided endpoint. Match all the products to win!

# Development

This project was implemented using an MVVM app architecture for compatability with any screen orientation. It includes a configurable number of required matches and a shuffle button. When shuffled, cards that are already matched will not be included in the shuffle, however cards that are selected are.

Third party libraries: Retrofit, Picasso.
